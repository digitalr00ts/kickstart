# Fedora 26 kickstart file - ks.cfg
#
# For more information on kickstart syntax and commands, refer to the
# Fedora Installation Guide:
# http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/19/html/Installation_Guide/s1-kickstart2-options.html
#
# For testing, you can fire up a local http server temporarily.
# cd to the directory where this ks.cfg file resides and run the following:
#    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
# You don't have to restart the server every time you make changes.  Python
# will reload the file from disk every time.  As long as you save your changes
# they will be reflected in the next HTTP download.  Then to test with
# a PXE boot server, enter the following on the PXE boot prompt:
#    > linux text ks=http://<your_ip>:8000/ks.cfg

# Required settings
rootpw vagrant
network --bootproto=dhcp
